          <p>There is a kingdom. The kingdom, as most kingdoms, had it's ups and downs, good rulers and bad, brave men and weak. It wasn't much more than an ordinary kingdom. Until it wasn't.</p>
          <p>An evil from the east arrived in the Kingdom. An evil unlike any that the kingdom had seen before. An evil so strong that many believed that the God's had left this existance. With this evil came an unrest in the natural world. Monsters that were once held at bay now roam free. The world, as it was known, is no more. No man or woman have had the strength to attempt to rid the Kingdom of this evil. No man or woman has had the courage to even try.</p>
          <p>That is until you came along...</p>
